# Welcome to 🤗 HuggingFace-Training

Welcome to the fascinating world of HuggingFace model training and experimentation!

This repository contains hands-on examples, experiments, and scripts for training models with HuggingFace libraries — from reinforcement learning agents to transformers for NLP tasks. Everything here is **completely free and open-source**.

---

## In this repo, i will:

- Learn to train RL agents in environments like `LunarLander-v2`.
- Fine-tune transformer models for text classification, token classification, and language modeling.
- Use clean, modular notebooks and scripts for your experiments.
- Share your trained models and reuse models from the community.

## What to expect?

In this repo, i will:

📖 **Study HuggingFace models**: From RL to NLP transformers.\
🧑‍💻 **Hands-on coding**: Train and fine-tune models with HuggingFace’s `transformers` and `datasets` libraries.\
🤖 **Experiment in RL environments**: Train agents in OpenAI Gym environments like `LunarLander-v2`.\
💾 **Reuse and share models**: Push models to HuggingFace Hub or download community models.\
🎓 **Build skills from beginner to expert**: Understand theory, implement it, and analyze results.
